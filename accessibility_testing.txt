1. Non-impaired users will benefit by having access to a more diverse array of opinions around them,
because people who are impaired might offer different perspectives to the content on that page if it is
an interactive medium like a forum. This brings new and potentially differently framed opinions
to a discussion, or simply brings a different lens of critical analysis to content consumption.
This leads to a generally more educated and aware community
which further enriches the educational and social value of the site content and the site audience's
general attitudes and beliefs.


2. One major design choice User Inyerface made was labeling prominent buttons with unintuitive phrases that took
a lot of cognitive effort to process, such as buttons with negative statements on them like a
checkbox next to "I do not agree to these terms", or a big green button labeled NO. I would change
this simply by replacing the labels of the buttons with something more traditionally expected
to correspond to them, such as having a big green button labeled GO TO NEXT PAGE rather than NO.

Another design choice Inyerface made was to use formatting in misleading ways. For instance, they
might underline one word, but hyperlink the next subsequent word which was not underlined. I would
instead use formatting to emphasize elements that are interactive on the page rather than
misleadingly emphasizing non-interactive elements with style like color/underlining.

Lastly, Inyerface put some important buttons in very subtle and hard to find/notice locations. For
instance, in a Lock popup, the button to close that popup was hidden in the bottom left in white
text which blended in with the popup background. I would instead put the close button
in a very prominent position in a high-contrast color to the background so people
can notice it quickly.


3. A change I made was to add associated labels to all of my form elements. This helps users who
rely assistive technologies to fill out forms by announcing what each form field is for. This
allows these users more easily fill out forms accurately and understands what the screen reader sees.

Another change I made was to make all my ARIA IDs unique. This allows assistive technologies
to read all the instances of elements on my webpage, rather than just the first instance
of multiple similarly ID'ed elements. This also improves general accessibility to the site
for people who rely on assistive technologies.

Another change I made was to add a [lang] attribute to my HTML attribute. This increased
accessibility because it explicitly declares the language of my website, so screen readers
will not accidentally assume a different language because I did not explicit state the language.

Lastly, a change I made was to add a meta description to my HTML document. This increased accesibility
because it helps people see a quick summary of the site without having to click into and explore
the site itself. This also helps draw in interested users who otherwise might have skipped over.

These changes resulted in a 100% rating for all the lighthouse categories.
